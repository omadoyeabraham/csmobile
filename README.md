TODO
  - Unsubscribe from the initial BehaviorSubject in the stb-summary Page
  - Add showing of more details on bond holdings
  - Add no stock holdings to replace graphs when necessary
  - switchportfolio defaults to 0 (currentPortfolioIndex) on page reload
  - Refactor getTradeOrders from stb-getters to call stbstore, so the storing of data is done in the store instead

  - LocalStorage structure
    + customer
    + stb
      - stb-portfiolios
    + fi
